	This becomes very important when you have classes with long names and many adjacent elements use that class, or several classes.

		Roadmap:
	</h3>
    <p> 
	    <strong>Short Term</strong>
		<br>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Finish the Sticky [DONE]
			</li>
			<li>
				Populate the sauce with informative comments 
				[
				HOMEPAGE [DONE]
				WIKI [PENDING]
				]
			</li>
			<li>
				Mirror the wiki [DONE]
			</li>
			<li>
				Make the website look prettier [REALLY NECESSARY?]
			</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		<strong>Long Term</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Get Webhosting via Bluehost from <a href="tomwoods.com/publicity" title="hello">Tom Woods' link</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				Operate higher-order separation of services via subdomains
			</li>
			<li>
				Run my blog, the sticky, a Matrix homeserver, a Xopow instance, a Peertube instance, and perhaps more on several subdomains
			</li>
			<li>
				Have a portion of the website dedicated to Witship, the willsome english word for science, but have it be generally non-mainstream in maintaining pure descriptive/normative purpose and making no assumptions, being as free of bias as possible, and having a good time having different non-mainstream historians, scientists, and so forth discussing their specialties.
				[DONE]
