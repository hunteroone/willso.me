    <p>This is intended to be as delightfully reactionary and backwards as I can make it, but under a phonology slightly closer to modern Indian English (although even the accent I use is hyperreactionary, because why not?) <br> For a more reasonable treatment of grammar, see <a href="Speececræft.html" title="Speececræft">Hunter's original version</a>, adapted from the Miraheze article.

   <p>First, I will address the rules for inflection in Willsome English based on those in Old English, modernized lightly. There are 5 cases: The Namenlic (Nominative), the Wragenlic (Accusative), the Forgifenlic (Dative), the Astreenenlic (Genitive), and the Toolfyllenlic (Instrumental). This is more conservative than even Icelandic, which fails to retain the Instrumental.</p>
   <p>There were three genders in old English, which are often called masculine, feminine, and neuter, but the way English handled these was rather complicated. It would naturally simplify a little into a more basic rule: The feminine is used for specifically feminine things, like women or a female animal (as well as concepts like learning, need, rest, and charity) whereas <a class="lingo" title="which was present in MSE up until the 21st century, albeit in a weaker form, called the Generic Masculine. You may know this from slightly archaic versions of sayings like 'He who does not learn from history is doomed to repeat it', which uses the masculine but doesn't exclude women">everything animate that is not explicitly female is referred to in the masculine</a> &amp;amp; everything inanimate and material (concepts are treated as feminine) was treated with a neuter gender.</p>
   <p>There were three numbers in Old English, but the dual form was only used in a set of first and second person pronouns. Otherwise, only singular and plural forms existed (dual pronouns are treated as plurals).</p>
   <p>There are three moods in Old, and by extension, Willsome English. The indicative mood (Sayenlic mete) is used when the speaker is making a statement, the subjunctive mood (Wishenlic mete) is used when the speaker is expressing a wish, reporting something, making a statement contrary to facts, or talking about something conditional on other variables. The imperative mood (Bddenlic mete) is used only when the speaker is making a command.</p>
   <p>There are 3 major tenses in Willsome English: Past, Present and Future. Each of these has subtenses. For instance, the continous present</p>
