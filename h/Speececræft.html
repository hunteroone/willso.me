            This is based on a mixture of the <a title="Old English">OE</a> article system and native palatal developments in Middle English.

        <h3 id="One">Indefinite Article declension</h3>
        <p>
            A and An are used today exclusively as the indefinite article, coming from Old English an. What was forgotten in Varad's Reactionary Grammar section (Sticky II of the <a href="/h/WillsomeEnglishEwbook.pdf">Ewbook 2.0</a>) is that "an" is in fact New English "one". Perhaps due to Norman influence, the formation of an → one in early ME became mixed with French on and as a result the older and newer form of the word split. This is further supported by how an was used in Old English as well as fellow West Germanic languages today (Dutch een and German ein) where "one" is the indefinite article and also "a particular" (i.e OE an of ðam → one of those). In a way, this means that our current understanding that "one" meaning "a particular" being from French influence is misconstrued. What's more likely is the underdevelopment of a/an is a result of French influence instead.
